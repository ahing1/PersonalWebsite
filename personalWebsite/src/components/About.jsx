        </h2>
        <p>
          I'm currently a Computer Science Student at Stevens Institute of Technology. 
          I love to learn and always looking to improve whether its professionally or personally. 
          I've taken a big interest into AI and plan on getting my Master's in Computer Science with a Concentration in Machine Learning to truly understand AI to its core. 
          With this knowledge I will try and help as many people as I can through tech.
